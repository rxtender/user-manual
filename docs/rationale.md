RXtender is built on the following ideas:

- IDL to expose reactive stream interfaces
- Clear separation between:
    - serialization
    - transport
    - stream APIs
- Generation of streams source and sink
- Extensible to new programming languages, serialization and transport protocols.

RXtender allows only to generate code for stream source and sinks. However it
is designed to be easily extensible to new programming languages and transports.
