RxTender is built on the following ideas:

- An IDL is used to specify reactive stream.
- There is a clear separation between:
    - serialization
    - transport
    - stream APIs
- It is possible to generate source and sink streams (c.f. ).
- Extensible to new programming languages, serialization and transport protocols.

RXtender allows only to generate code for stream source and sinks. However it
is designed to be easily extensible to new programming languages and transports.
