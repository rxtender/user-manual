RxTender is framework to implement code generators of remote reactive streams.
With RxTender, inter-process and inter-machine communication with reactive
streams is very easy. The idea of RxTender came after trying many IPC and RPC
protocols and code generators. Some of them were flexible but non productive to
use, while others were easy to use but too restricted.

RxTender is based on the idea of allowing implementing Reactive Stream APIs
over inter-process and network communication for any language, any transport
protocol, and any serialization. One of the main benefits of RxtTender is that
you can easily extend it for your developement environment and save a lot of
time.
