RxTender is code generator for reactive oriented inter-process and
inter-machine communication. The idea of RxTender came after trying many IPC
and RPC protocols and code generators. Some of them were flexible but non
productive to use, while others were easy to use but too restricted.

RxTender is based on the idea of allowing implementing Reactive Stream APIs
over inter-process and network communication for any language, any transport
protocol, and any serialization. One of the main benefits of RxtTender is that
you can easily extend it for your development environment and save a lot of
time.
